    4. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn the first few years of running my business, my biggest struggle was not knowing how to organize all my creative thoughts, and I think that chaos was reflected in the lack of results I was seeing with my small business. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m so happy I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve found tools like Milanote that just make my life as a small business owner SO much easier and I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t imagine creating a product launch without it anymore.

Moodboarding is another great way to conceptualize and visually organize what you want your art style to encompass
A great tool to organize your references or inspiration is on Milanote
I have my main project board here, and a few sub-boards with specific character design or brushes
A lot of my inspiration comes from Pinterest, and what I love is you can make a direct link to the site so you can easily relay back to the original artist/source

They also have built-in templates if organization isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t your forte
