## Milanote Overview

### **üé®¬†What is Milanote?**

**Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects** 

Milanote exists to help people think and plan better at the early stages of the creative process. It‚Äôs a flexible and unstructured workspace that lets ideas grow in whatever way makes sense to you. It feels less like traditional software and more like working on a wall in a creative studio.

### **üöÄ¬†Getting familiar with Milanote**

If you're new to Milanote, start by [**signing up for a free account](https://milanote.com/register).** We suggest spending some time **[familiarising yourself with Milanote](https://youtu.be/OaWhH_5-XH8?si=ahS6V-U_2pnc5yn_)**. Trying the product will allow you to understand how the features work and how they can fit into your creative process, as well as give you an opportunity to come up with ideas for a good project to share with your audience.

## Step 1: Choose your video topic and project idea

Milanote is designed to help you plan and organize your creative projects. For your video, select a project that not only showcases how you use Milanote to bring your creative ideas to life but also aligns with your chosen video topic.

> For example, if you‚Äôre video topic is a new film you‚Äôre about to work on, you could make Milanote boards showcasing the pre-production and a call sheet of all the scenes you need on shot day.
> 

Once you have decided on a video topic and related Milanote project, share it with us for review. 

<aside>
‚úÖ  **Suggestions for your Milanote project:**

- Make a pre-production plan for your project
- Create a storyboard for your script
- Collect inspiration in a moodboard
- Make a shot list of the things you want to capture
- Write out a gear list
</aside>

**Pro Tip:** When choosing your video topic and Milanote project, integrate Milanote into the video in a way that feels natural, authentic and relevant to your audience. This approach ensures it adds genuine value to your content and feels less like a promotional message.

## **Step 2: Draft your Milanote boards and script for the segment**

### Boards

Once we've agreed on the video topic and how Milanote fits in, you can begin assembling the Milanote boards you will show in your video. In most cases, this will be the audience‚Äôs first impression of Milanote, so your boards will need to be well-presented, look visually engaging and showcase the correct usage of the tool. When you've completed your Milanote boards, please share a link with us for review. 

üì¢Please make sure¬†that '[Invite editors via a link](https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/4324593-sharing-a-board#h_fc975be060)' is enabled,¬†as tips/ suggestions may be added to the boards.

<aside>

**üé®¬†Guidelines for Creating Your Boards:**

- **Multiple Boards:** Ensure you complete at least two boards. For example, create a [Project Plan](https://milanote.com/templates/project-plans) and a [Moodboard](https://milanote.com/templates/moodboards) .
- **Variety of Elements**: Include various elements such as notes, images, website links, sketches, task cards, and color swatches.
- **Visual Appeal**: Design your boards to be visually engaging. Use a balanced mix of images, arrows linking related cards, and a thoughtfully planned layout.
- **Board Titles**: Choose goal-oriented titles for your boards, such as ‚ÄòClient Brief‚Äô or ‚ÄòMoodboard‚Äô, to clearly indicate their purpose.
</aside>

<aside>

**What to Avoid:**

- **Empty Cards:** Steer clear of including blank note cards or task lists.
- **YouTube References:** Avoid using YouTube-related names or references, such as "YouTube Board" or "Brand Sponsorship Script." Avoid showcasing planning out thumbnails and video titles.
- **Insufficient Content:** Ensure boards are not sparse or lacking in meaningful content.
- **Aimless Content Dumps:** Refrain from creating boards that lack focus, depth, or clear goals.
- **Uninspiring Visuals:** Avoid boards that are overly text-heavy or content is arranged in an uninspiring way. (See example below)
    
    
    ![**‚ùå¬†Before** - Empty cards with minimal content and superficial project planning.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f5b7cb5-5baf-41b5-b716-521be14b7257/547a376f-880b-4375-9734-52d823369dcd/CleanShot_2024-04-06_at_12.11.072x.png)

### Script

Once your boards are approved, you can begin preparing your draft script. We require at least a rough outline before filming starts to prevent post-production changes and reshoots. There's no need to provide a complete script for the entire integration‚Äîjust the main bullet points of what you plan to do. We encourage you to talk about Milanote in a way that feels genuine and authentic to your profession. For example:

üõë **What to avoid in your script**

- **Neglecting an Introduction:** Avoid diving straight into your project without first explaining what Milanote is. Briefly describe ‚ÄúMilanote is a tool for organizing¬†your¬†creative projects.‚Äù
- **Sign-Up Instructions:** Refrain from mentioning 'downloading' Milanote. Instead, direct users to 'sign up for free.'
- **Forgetting Call to Action:** Remember to encourage your viewers to sign up using the link in the description.

## **Step 3: Shoot your draft video**

Now that we've reviewed and approved your boards and script, you can begin filming the Milanote integration portion of the video. We recommend using screen capture software such as [**Loom**](https://www.loom.com/products/chrome-screen-recorder?utm_xl=&utm_term=screen%20record%20extension&utm_campaign=loom_google_6800_self-serve_web_au_google-search_conversions_cpa_work-signup_non-brand_x_4-5-2023_screen-recorder&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&utm_content=chrome_cta&hsa_acc=4481576800&hsa_cam=16517711969&hsa_grp=135659264353&hsa_ad=656008094593&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-858957896370&hsa_kw=screen%20record%20extension&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAxaCvBhBaEiwAvsLmWNUFbzvQPpfU1FYWmRBcWPOIC8NYycD9MYHnxT3g4EOvMwiLymJHRhoCQ_oQAvD_BwE). Capturing the entire window offers the clearest view of your content and the Milanote interface, and gives the audience a good sense of what it's like to actually use the software.

<aside>
üí° **How to showcase your screen recording:**

- Display our [**animated logo**](https://media.milanote.com/p/files/1OX4gd1zwuCTfk/soi/MILANOTE-Sponsored-short-light.mov) at the first mention of Milanote.
- Ensure correct pronunciation of "Milanote" by referring to this [pronunciation guide](https://www.howtopronounce.com/milanote#google_vignette).
- Start screen recordings from the main project board, not an empty **Home** screen.
- Show the entirety of your Milanote boards on-screen. Including the toolbar and title bars. It's completely fine to film¬†*some*¬†sections using an external camera pointed at your screen, but this should be used sparingly.
- Try not to rush through your Milanote boards and allow the viewer time to gain a better understanding of how you‚Äôre using it and how they might use it themselves.
</aside>

<aside>
üõë **What to avoid in your video**

- Avoid using other clips of Milanote found online or from milanote.com
- Don‚Äôt start on an empty board or the home screen
- Don‚Äôt add any distracting visual effects i.e. excessive zooming in on the board / excessive cropping of the interface.
- The first time each element in Milanote‚Äôs toolbar is used, it triggers a tooltip popup‚Äîmake sure these have all been triggered before you begin shooting your video. You should also make sure to disable any distracting browser extensions (eg. Grammarly) or toolbars before you start recording.

## **Step 4:** Publish the video and receive payment
