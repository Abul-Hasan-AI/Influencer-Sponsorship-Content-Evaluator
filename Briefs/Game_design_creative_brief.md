## Milanote Overview

### **üé®¬†What is Milanote?**

**Milanote is a tool for organizing creative projects** 

Milanote exists to help people think and plan better at the early stages of the creative process. It‚Äôs a flexible and unstructured workspace that lets ideas grow in whatever way makes sense to you. It feels less like traditional software and more like working on a wall in a creative studio.

### **üöÄ¬†Getting familiar with Milanote**

If you're new to Milanote, start by [**signing up for a free account](https://milanote.com/register).** We suggest spending some time **[familiarising yourself with Milanote](https://youtu.be/OaWhH_5-XH8?si=ahS6V-U_2pnc5yn_)**. Trying the product will allow you to understand how the features work and how they can fit into your creative process, as well as give you an opportunity to come up with ideas for a good project to share with your audience.

## Step 1: Choose your video topic and project idea

Start by brainstorming ideas for your video topic and ways that a Milanote project could be integrated. The two should be closely related for a more natural integration. 

> For example**,** if you‚Äôre video topic is about the game characters, you could make Milanote boards showing their relationships or a moodboard of the visual direction.
> 

Once you have decided on a video topic and related Milanote project, share it with us for review. 

<aside>
‚úÖ  **Suggestions for your Milanote project:**

- Make a plan for your project
- Brainstorm idea for the game
- Collect inspiration in a moodboard
- Make a character profile
- Explore the game character relationships
- Build a level design board
</aside>

**Pro Tip:** When choosing your video topic and Milanote project, integrate Milanote into the video in a way that feels natural, authentic and relevant to your audience. This approach ensures it adds genuine value to your content and feels less like a promotional message.

## **Step 2: Draft your Milanote boards and script for the segment**

### Boards

Once we've agreed on the video topic and how Milanote fits in, you can begin assembling the Milanote boards you will show in your video. In most cases, this will be the audience‚Äôs first impression of Milanote, so your boards will need to be well-presented, look visually engaging and showcase the correct usage of the tool. When you've completed your Milanote boards, please share a link with us for review. 

<aside>
üì¢ Please make sure¬†that '[Invite editors via a link](https://help.milanote.com/en/articles/4324593-sharing-a-board#h_fc975be060)' is enabled,¬†as small edits are occasionally made to the boards.

</aside>

<aside>

**üé®¬†Guidelines for Creating Your Boards:**

- **Multiple Boards:** Ensure you complete one project board and one sub-board. For example, create a [Project Plan](https://milanote.com/templates/project-plans) and a [Moodboard](https://milanote.com/templates/moodboards) as the sub-board.
- **Variety of Elements**: Include various elements such as notes, images, website links, sketches, task cards, and color swatches.
- **Visual Appeal**: Design your boards to be visually engaging. Use a balanced mix of images, arrows linking related cards, and a thoughtfully planned layout.
- **Board Titles**: Choose goal-oriented titles for your boards, such as ‚ÄòClient Brief‚Äô or ‚ÄòMoodboard‚Äô, to clearly indicate their purpose.
</aside>

<aside>

**What to Avoid:**

- **Empty Cards:** Steer clear of including blank note cards or task lists.
- **YouTube References:** Avoid using YouTube-related names or references, such as "YouTube Board" or "Brand Sponsorship Script." Avoid showcasing planning out thumbnails and video titles.
- **Insufficient Content:** Ensure boards are not sparse or lacking in meaningful content.
- **Aimless Content Dumps:** Refrain from creating boards that lack focus, depth, or clear goals.
- **Uninspiring Visuals:** Avoid boards that are overly text-heavy or content is arranged in an uninspiring way. (See example below)
    
    
    ![**‚ùå¬†Before** - Empty cards with minimal content and superficial project planning.](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f5b7cb5-5baf-41b5-b716-521be14b7257/547a376f-880b-4375-9734-52d823369dcd/CleanShot_2024-04-06_at_12.11.072x.png)

### Script

Once your boards are approved, you can begin preparing your draft script. We require at least a rough outline before filming starts to prevent post-production changes and reshoots. There's no need to provide a complete script for the entire integration‚Äîjust the main bullet points of what you plan to do. We encourage you to talk about Milanote in a way that feels genuine and authentic to your profession. For example:

<aside>
üõë **What to avoid in your script**

- **Mentioning YouTube Planning:** Since many viewers may not be YouTubers, discussing how you use Milanote for YouTube content planning may not be relatable; such as YouTube thumbnail, title, and posting schedule.
- **Neglecting an Introduction:** Avoid diving straight into your project without first explaining what Milanote is. Briefly describe ‚ÄúMilanote is a tool for organizing¬†your¬†creative projects.‚Äù
- **Sign-Up Instructions:** Refrain from mentioning 'downloading' Milanote. Instead, direct users to 'sign up for free.'
- **Forgetting Call to Action:** Remember to encourage your viewers to sign up using the link in the description.
</aside>

## **Step 3: Shoot your draft video**

Now that we've reviewed and approved your boards and script, you can begin filming the Milanote integration portion of the video. We recommend using screen capture software such as [**Loom**](https://www.loom.com/products/chrome-screen-recorder?utm_xl=&utm_term=screen%20record%20extension&utm_campaign=loom_google_6800_self-serve_web_au_google-search_conversions_cpa_work-signup_non-brand_x_4-5-2023_screen-recorder&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&utm_content=chrome_cta&hsa_acc=4481576800&hsa_cam=16517711969&hsa_grp=135659264353&hsa_ad=656008094593&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-858957896370&hsa_kw=screen%20record%20extension&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAxaCvBhBaEiwAvsLmWNUFbzvQPpfU1FYWmRBcWPOIC8NYycD9MYHnxT3g4EOvMwiLymJHRhoCQ_oQAvD_BwE). Capturing the entire window offers the clearest view of your content and the Milanote interface, and gives the audience a good sense of what it's like to actually use the software.

üé® **Guidelines for Creating Your Video:**

- **Logo:** Display our [**animated logo**](https://media.milanote.com/p/files/1OX4gd1zwuCTfk/soi/MILANOTE-Sponsored-short-light.mov) at the first mention of Milanote.
- **Milanote Pronunciation:** Ensure the correct pronunciation of "Milanote" by referring to this [pronunciation guide](https://www.howtopronounce.com/milanote#google_vignette).
- **Tool Interface:** Show the entirety of your Milanote boards on-screen. Including the toolbar and title bars.
- **Tool Visibility:** Ensure that Milanote is prominently and frequently shown on screen throughout the video. Avoid static or minimal views of the boards.
- **B-roll**: Using an external camera for some sections is completely fine but should be limited. Ensure clarity when filming iPad screens, but primarily showcase Milanote on the desktop app.
- **Interaction:** Frequently interact with your boards‚Äîdrag and drop features, add images, add text, and move elements around ([see example here](https://file.notion.so/f/f/4f5b7cb5-5baf-41b5-b716-521be14b7257/95f88e9b-540d-4a8f-9473-c3e717677f75/UX_design_video_clip.mp4?table=block&id=f168e21e-48f6-4f45-b92f-d07590e897c2&spaceId=4f5b7cb5-5baf-41b5-b716-521be14b7257&expirationTimestamp=1726286400000&signature=MmVtnyKDF_EfYvMSi1riGWdh7TXqGulL4cGhSrx5fMA&downloadName=UX+design+video+clip.mp4))
- **Start Screen Recordings:** Begin recordings from the project board, not from an empty **Home** screen (see example below)
    
    
    ![**‚úÖ¬†Show Project board**](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f5b7cb5-5baf-41b5-b716-521be14b7257/251e6128-5a64-4d48-b49a-74a888401339/CleanShot_2024-03-25_at_13.16.492x.png)

    **‚ùå¬†Avoid showing Home screen**
    
</aside>

<aside>
üõë **What To Avoid:**

- **External Clips:** Avoid using clips of Milanote sourced from online platforms or [milanote.com](http://milanote.com/). Instead, focus on creating original content, and refrain from including footage of scrolling on the website ([see example](https://file.notion.so/f/f/4f5b7cb5-5baf-41b5-b716-521be14b7257/a4b6ed80-0725-4f13-89dc-630f750f9b1d/CleanShot_2024-09-13_at_12.13.10.mp4?table=block&id=0773046d-de98-4c4e-b443-4a9197a56f85&spaceId=4f5b7cb5-5baf-41b5-b716-521be14b7257&expirationTimestamp=1726286400000&signature=xwHuxFlTlBxp_i6MdpUkFYhFqsy-8hpvrs79l3sUx8c&downloadName=CleanShot+2024-09-13+at+12.13.10.mp4)).
- **Distracting Visual Effects:** Avoid adding any distracting visual effects i.e. excessive zooming in on the board / excessive cropping of the interface.
- **Quick Pacing:** Avoid rushing through your Milanote boards - allow the viewer enough time to gain a better understanding of how the tool works.
- **Tooltip Pop-ups:** If you‚Äôre new to Milanote, the tooltip pop-up will appear during the onboarding stage. Make sure to trigger all tooltips before shooting, and disable any distracting browser extensions (e.g., Grammarly) or toolbars.
- **Board scrolling:** While showcasing fully completed boards is useful, it‚Äôs crucial to include interactions like dragging and dropping elements, rearranging items, and actively building your boards on-screen. Increased interaction helps viewers better understand how Milanote works.
